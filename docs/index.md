# Welcome to datakb

**datakb** is a data knowledge base. Our goal is to write a guide on good data practices for bigger size Enterprises. There is a lot of information about analytics and AI out there, but it is usually either too technical or not detailed enough, we would like to correct that by creating a guide that caters to technical and business professionals and goes into the details of what works and what doesn't.

### Principles

This is an opinionated guide, and we follow strictly the following principles:


- Data initiatives **must add value**. By adding value, we mean that data initiatives should enhance business processes, outcomes, or capabilities. We do not believe in building technology in a vacuum.
- The TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) increase over time must be considered. Too often, we have seen data science projects promise significant transformations but end up causing substantial increases in IT costs with minimal impact to show for it.
- Business knowledge is crucial to creating value in data initiatives; close business proximity is essential for effective analytics.
- Data governance is critical; without it, companies risk developing a complex web of databases, tables, files, and code that becomes increasingly difficult and expensive to maintain over time.
- Data teams should be organized around clear principles, goals, and rules of engagement. Data organizations should be intentionally built to remove obstacles and support value creation.
