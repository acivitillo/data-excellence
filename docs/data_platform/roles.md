# Roles in Data-Driven Organizations

In modern organizations, various roles contribute to the design, development, and operation of data-driven systems. These roles collaborate to ensure that data flows smoothly through its lifecycle, from generation to consumption in analytics, machine learning, and business processes. Data engineers act as a crucial link between upstream data producers and downstream data consumers, enabling a seamless data engineering flow.
